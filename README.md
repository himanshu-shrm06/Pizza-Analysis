## Overview

The Pizza Sales dataset comprises all the orders processed by the Pizza Sales.

This comprehensive table encapsulates worldwide orders placed in 2015, encompassing extensive details such as order date, order ID, Pizza name, category, Pizza Size, Total price, and an array of other relevant columns.

The project encompasses a diverse range of five unique chart types all integrated into the Dashboard. Within this interface, key performance indicators (KPIs) meticulously capture comprehensive sales data across various Categories, Orders, and profit metrics.

Through the use of charts and slicers, you can easily discern the top-performing metrics like Revenue, Quantity, and Orders, pinpointing the best and worst sales factors that significantly impact business growth.

Additionally, I've incorporated buttons and sliders to enable seamless remote navigation between pages, enhancing user accessibility and efficiency.
